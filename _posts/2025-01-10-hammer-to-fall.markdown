Hammer To Fall is a short single-player Virtual Reality game created as part of the annual iGGi Game Jam, hosted by the EPSRC CDT for Intelligent Games & Game Intelligence (iGGi).

The game was conceptualised, prototyped, programmed and playtested within the week of the Game Jam. Created in collaboration with Dominik Jeurissen, Karl Clarke and Philip Smith, all fellow iGGi PhD students at Queen Mary University of London. This was programmed in Unity.

The objective of the game is simple - you are given a workbench in front of you, and you have ten seconds to hammer all of the nails into the workbench. There are five levels to complete. The player's score is tracked by how accurate the hammer is swung, and how fast all of the nails are completed in each level.

As this is built using a Virtual Reality headset such as Oculus, gameplay success depends upon the player themselves and how they use the motion controllers. This was a slight issue we noticed during the playtesting stage at the end of the Game Jam, as some of our shorter peers and fellow research students had a little trouble reaching some of the higher nails in the final levels that we overlooked in the development stage. Still, this did receive the "Hammer Time" award at the Game Jam, and overall was very fun to work on during the short time span we had.
