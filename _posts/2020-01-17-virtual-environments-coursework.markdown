This is a Virtual Reality Escape Room, created as coursework for our Fourth Year module Virtual Environments at UCL. Created in collaboration with Dabeer Mirza, Julia Ronneberger and Ruizhe "Ray" Zheng. This was programmed in C# within Unity.

This escape room takes the form of a four-levelled series of trials, where the player is being recruited by an all-powerful wizard (voicelines provided by me!) to become their next apprentice. The trials use a mixture of virtual and augmented reality, requiring some physical setup for certain rooms. The player is allowed to freely move around the room both physically and by teleporting.

The four challenges are as follows:

- Julia's Room (top-left): An augmented reality room, where the player must extinguish a fire by activating a water pipe. This is done by weighing the correct-sized boxes onto a physical table, and then moving a physical pipe extension to align with the virtual pipes in order to complete the water flow.

- Ray's Room (top-right): A virtual room, where the player must extinguish a pattern of fire pits in the style of Whac-A-Mole by blowing into the VR headset's mouthpiece.

- Toby's Room (bottom-left): A virtual room, where the player must solve an air pressure problem by turning the valves on the pipes to unlock a key, as a four-node binary calculator. There is a series of locks which are disabled depending upon the total pressure from the pipes

- Dabeer's Room (bottom-right): A virtual room, where the player must solve a Vigen√®re cipher script puzzle to unlock a safe, and provide the safe's hidden item to the wizard to complete.
