[The game is also playable on itch.io here][itch].

Hades of State is a roguelike tech demo created as part of the Game Development 2 training module during the first year of my PhD research at the EPSRC CDT for Intelligent Games & Game Intelligence (iGGi).

The game was conceptualised, prototyped, programmed and playtested within the second week of the module, after spending the first week learning about procedural content generation. Created in collaboration with Sara Cardinale (a fellow Computer Science student at Queen Mary University of London) and Sarah Masters (a fellow iGGi PhD student at the University of York). This was programmed in C# within Unity.

The game is loosely based on Dante's Inferno, where the player, having recently died and become a shade, must delve through the Nine Circles of Hell through a series of procedurally generated random maze layouts. To progress, they must converse with each circle's guardian, a historical or political figure of more recent times (often for humorous effect). The player's responses during conversation affects how guilty of each sin they are.
