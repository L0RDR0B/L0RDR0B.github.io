Pseudo-Judo is a two-player versus wrestling game created as part of the annual iGGi Game Jam, hosted by the EPSRC CDT for Intelligent Games & Game Intelligence (iGGi).

The game was conceptualised, prototyped, programmed and playtested within the two days of the Game Jam, and won the "It's Not A Bug, It's A Feature" award that year. Created in collaboration with Oliver Withington, Bobby Khaleque and Dimitris Menexopoulos, all fellow iGGi PhD students at either Queen Mary University of London or University of York. This was programmed in C# within Unity.

The game is a very basic wrestling game, where the objective is to knock your opponent out of the ring to score points. However, due to the wonky physics of moving the characters' limbs individually (a feature that we purposefully leaned into given the time constraints), more often than not you might knock yourself out before them, so watch out!
