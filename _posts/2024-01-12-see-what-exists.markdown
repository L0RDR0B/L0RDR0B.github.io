[The full project can be found on the GitHub Repository][github].

[The game is also playable on itch.io here][itch].

See What Exists is a single-player exploration game demo created as part of the annual iGGi Game Jam, hosted by the EPSRC CDT for Intelligent Games & Game Intelligence (iGGi).

The game was conceptualised, prototyped, programmed and playtested within the two days of the Game Jam, and won the "Best Mechanics" award that year. Created in collaboration with Callum Deery, Dan Cooke, George Long and Sunny Thaicharoen, all fellow iGGi PhD students at either Queen Mary University of London or University of York. This was programmed in Godot.

The demo is of a very basic 2D exploration game, with the key mechanic being that objects (including enemies and obstacles) only exist when they are directly observed by the player. This leads to interesting situations, where the player must be actively looking away from barriers that would otherwise prevent them from continuing, whilst also keeping track of where enemies have moved to, among other sight-based puzzles.

Due to the time limitation of the Game Jam to work on this, the game is not as refined as it could be. Additionally, I believe the uploaded demo on itch.io is an older, out-of-date version, and as such you might not actually be able to complete the first level.
