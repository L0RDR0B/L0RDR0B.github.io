## About

Welcome to my website!

My name is Toby. I'm a PhD researcher at Queen Mary's University of London, studying as part of [Intelligent Games & Game Intelligence (iGGi)][iggi]. Before that, I completed my MEng Mathematical Computation at University College London in 2020.

Here on this website you can find my research project, my portfolio of various projects, courseworks and game jams I have worked on over the years, as well as my publications and papers.

Please, make yourself at home!
